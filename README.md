- 👋 Hi, I’m @ButFace69
-  I’m interested in art, writing, and music. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to code python, rasberry pi, and how to make authentic 8-bit music from live audio clips.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on gaming projects not only for rasberry pi but eventually something for pc games as well.
